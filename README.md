## Usage:

1. Navigate to a `.travis.yml` file in SublimeText
2. Press:

|    OS   | Key Combination           |
| ------- | ---------------           |
| Linux   | ctrl + alt + T            |
| Mac     | super(âŒ˜) + alt + ctrl + T |
| Windows | ctrl + alt + T            |

This will grab the yml file and validate it against the web linter. Any errors will be displayed to a plugin specific output panel.

## Installation

## Developers

Appreciate the help! Here is stuff you should probably know:

### Install for both Sublime Text 2 and 3:

Some folks prefer to clone the git repo right into their SublimeText `Packages` folder. While this is probably ok for most users, I prefer to create a symbolic link to the package so that I can point to the plugin from both flavors of SublimeText (for testing and the like...)

```sh
cd ~/dev
git clone git@github.com:sabhiram/sublime-travis-yml-lint.git sublime-travis-yml-lint
ln -s sublime-travis-yml-lint ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/sublime-travis-yml-lint
ln -s sublime-travis-yml-lint ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/sublime-travis-yml-lint
```

## Versions Released
